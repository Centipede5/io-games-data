# Data for io games

There are now hundreds of "io games" â€” simple browser MMOs that allow you to play with one click. There are also a lot of portals that refer traffic to these games. Developers have a hard time keeping track of all these portals, and submitting their games. This is a way for portal owners, game developers and interested players to access and contribute to open-source data about io games.

## Using

You can clone or download this repository, and access the data in `data.json`. It contains an array of objects with data about io games such as name, URL and thumbnail.

## Format

Each game is a JSON-object with this structure:

 - `name`: string, Example.io
 - `url`: string, https://example.io/
 - `synopsis`: string, short description
 - `description`: string, extended description
 - `thumbnail`: string, image URL
 - `published`: string, yyyy/mm/dd
 - `secure`: boolean, HTTPS connection
 - `developer`: object
   - `name`: string, Developer
   - `twitter`: string, handle

## Contributing

Simply submit a pull request to add, edit or remove your game. Do not make changes to games that you don't own (verification may be required).
